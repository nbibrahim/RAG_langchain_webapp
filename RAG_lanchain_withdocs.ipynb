Dr. Almond trained in interventional cardiology and was highly regarded for his clinical expertise and teaching skills. Among his many career accomplishments, Dr. Almond helped to establish the renowned interventional cardiology program at London Health Science Centre. Dr. Morgan, who attended medical school with the aid of bursaries and scholarships, worked across Canada while maintaining strong ties to his home in Newfoundland. He trained in echocardiography with a special interest in left ventricular function, and was beloved by patients, colleagues, family and friends. Both physicians were known for their compassion and ability to help patients feel comfortable and empowered in their care. Their families encourage the recipient of this bursary to strive for balance between their career in medicine, and with the personal activities and relationships that bring them happiness. Valued at a portion of the income on the endowment, the bursary will be awarded annually to a student from Newfoundland and Labrador who has completed their third year of the MD program at Memorial University of Newfoundland.

       "  'text': 'Team 1984 Award in Autism Education and Research\\nThis award was established by donations from the Faculty of Medicine Class of 1984 and friends. Initiated by the fundraising efforts of Dr. Peter Bartlett and Dr. Richard Hu, the award aims to forward education and research in the area of Autism Spectrum Disorder and associated cognitive development. Valued at a portion of the income on the endowment, it will be awarded annually to a student in the Doctor of Medicine program who has a demonstrated interest in education or research in the area of Autism Spectrum Disorder or associated cognitive development. The recipient must meet the minimum academic requirements for an award. Applications are available from the Student Affairs Office, Faculty of Medicine. This award will be granted by the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Scholarships, Bursaries and Awards on the recommendation of the Dean of Medicine’s Advisory Committee on Scholarships, Bursaries and Awards.\\nUndergraduate Award in Professional Studies\\nThe Undergraduate Award in Professional Studies was established by Mr. Alan Rowe (B.Comm. ’78) through a generous donation to the Dare To Campaign. Eligible candidates must be Indigenous students from Labrador or the Territories of Canada who are enrolled full- time in the entrance year of an undergraduate professional program. Two new recipients will be selected each year on a rotating basis, between the Faculties of Business Administration, Engineering and Applied Science, Medicine, Nursing, Education and the Schools of Pharmacy, and Social Work. The award is valued at $2,500 per year and is renewable for up to three additional years (four years in total) if the recipient continues to be enrolled full-time in an undergraduate professional program and maintains clear academic standing as defined by Memorial University of Newfoundland. If a successful candidate entering a professional program is not identified in the discipline on rotation in a given year, an eligible student from one of the other disciplines may be selected. If no eligible student is identified from the entering year of any professional program, then the award may be given to a student beyond entrance level in a professional program. Preference will be given to students who have demonstrated financial need. The award is granted by the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Scholarships, Bursaries and Awards in consultation with the Indigenous Student Resource Centre as needed.\\nDarshan (Beeji) Wadhwa Memorial Scholarship in Medicine',\n",
